Alternative borph server
------------------------

A version of the borph server which uses the kat control protocol.
This code is intended to be run on a bee2 to illustrate how the 
kat control infrastructure looks.

altborphserver needs to link against libkatcp, so the library
has to be built first. 

The C library lives in lib/katcp, python and java libraries which can 
speak katcp to altborphserver are be found in the software svn 
repository, 

altborphserver implements all commands other than exec found in the 
cborphserver.

altborphserver provides a help command - telnet into the server
and type "?help" to see the list of commands. All commands
start with an "?".

The kat control protocol escapes certain characters with a \, so
use \n, \r, \\, \ , and \0 to escape newline, carriage return,
backslash, space and null.
