This is bin2ocd - a utility to convert binary
files into a format which can be used as a
macro by the Macraigor OCD commander.

The macros can then be used to load a given
memory region using jtag. 

bin2ocd understands a few commandline options,
use -h to see them. 

A simple example use:

  bin2ocd -b 0x70000000 file.bin > file.mac
