* Work in progress, not yet usable *

  - a bit scary - to many objects/structures wrap too many 
    layers, the plan was to have a fair bit of the multiserver
    api be the same as the plain katcp one, unsure if that has
    been a success. 
    
    Also, the message (mul_msg) structure (and api) is rather similar
    to the katcp one, except the latter does immediate escaping. 
    The two could be folded somehow

Preliminary work towards a control server

  - requires libloop (external package)
  - requires libkatcp (kat control protocol library)
