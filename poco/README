Notes for Wed Aug 26 17:34:14 SAST 2009

  - coarse delay parser incomplete (poco_delay_cmd in poco.c)

  - poco_delay_cmd should schedule run_fixer in fixer.c, or 
    call schedule_fixer which then schedules run_fixer 

  - the dram logic should look at the stamp value to check that we 
    are starting at the correct point (in run_dram in dram.c)

  - poco-snap-shot to be done

  - meta and data packets should report timestamp information (timestamp
    and timestamp scaling)
