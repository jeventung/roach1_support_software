Check if I write to control or control0, ensuring that I preserve info on control0, not control

Have toggle ram schedule periodic runs better, so that
it happens closer to start time

Write support logic to deal with high precision timing/mcount
without requiring fpu

Start work on fine delay/phase shifts

Implement stubs for fine delay functions

# Re-implement sensor logic

/**********************************************************************/

request mode change
run  borph file
enter programming mode
enter poco mode

in poco

  - init 10Gbe interfaces, set local ip/mac
  
  - arm/sync: check that pps was received and device locked (read register after timeout)
    issue inform to tell when pps synced clocks (time zero)

  - set fft shift

- capture destination

- capture start

Error  conditions
-----------------

  - 10Gbe network status (rx, tx, link)
  - ADC overrange

More notes
----------

Deal with aborted borph processes sanely - currently only
a core watch is notified - should show up in the
poco logic somewhow too, otherwise it thinks everything is still
ok
